      "there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box . \n",
      "i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route . \n",
      "the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise . \n",
      "the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers . \n",
      "here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of \" plastic-like \" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy . \n",
      "i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it . \n",
      "t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's . \n",
      "while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it . \n",
      "from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone . \n",
      "whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio . \n",
      "overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned . \n",
      "while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece . \n",
      "this phone is a winner ... \n",
      "anything this phone does , it does perfectly . \n",
      "you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . \n",
      "this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in . \n",
      "this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly . \n",
      "i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . \n",
      "anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception . \n",
      "another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . \n",
      "when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light . \n",
      "this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . \n",
      "i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . \n",
      "it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light . \n",
      "this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial . \n",
      "overall , i highly recommend this phone . \n",
      "size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you . \n",
      "surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available . \n",
      "nice little phone ... light compact . . \n",
      "i like the size and weight of this little critter . \n",
      "but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. . \n",
      "- bright , visible screen \n",
      "i like the speakphone function a lot . \n",
      "i like the automatic key lock function . \n",
      "the phone is very light weight . \n",
      "while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones . \n",
      "and really this is the best phone one could have . \n",
      "this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc . \n",
      "its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside . \n",
      "i am enjoying my phone a lot .... \n",
      "battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . \n",
      "nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception . \n",
      "the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk . \n",
      "i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets . \n",
      "overall this is a slightly better than average phone . \n",
      "this is the best phone i have seen . \n",
      "you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games . \n",
      "the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing . \n",
      "i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it . \n",
      "i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had . \n",
      "the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it . \n",
      "for a specific location , i still think its a great phone . \n",
      "nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them . \n",
      "i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) . \n",
      "i highly recommend this phone to anyone . \n",
      "this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) . \n",
      "the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . \n",
      "the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) . \n",
      "additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. ) \n",
      "the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy . \n",
      "i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime . \n",
      "not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want . \n",
      "however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off . \n",
      "it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps . \n",
      "great phone .. . \n",
      "i have had no problems with the phone . \n",

      "excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures . \n",
      "great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! ! \n",
      "i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it . \n",
      "this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones . \n",
      "1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone . \n",
      "i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before . \n",
      "first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better . \n",
      "it has a classic design yet looks hip . \n",
